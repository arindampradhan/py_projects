##Summary
This is just the tiniest tip of the iceberg of what regular expressions can do. 

Be familiar with the following techniques:
• ^ matches the beginning of a string.
• $ matches the end of a string.
• \b matches a word boundary.
• \d matches any numeric digit.
• \D matches any non-numeric character.
• x? matches an optional x character (in other words, it matches an x zero or one times).
• x* matches x zero or more times.
• x+ matches x one or more times.
• x{n,m} matches an x character at least n times, but not more than m times.
• (a|b|c) matches either a or b or c .
• (x) in general is a remembered group. You can get the value of what matched by using the groups()
method of the object returned by re.search .
